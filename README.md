## Hi I'm Marc 👋

After 8+ years working in a paid media agency, most recently as VP of Product Technology & Integrations, I stepped away in late 2024 to return to hands-on software engineering.

These days, I'm focused on full-stack and product engineering. I like working across the stack; building stuff that balances pragmatism and polish, without overengineering. Most of my recent work is in React, TypeScript, and Python.
